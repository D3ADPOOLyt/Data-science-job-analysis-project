Title: Data Science Job Market Analysis Project

Date: 30th April 2024

Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into the global data science job market. By analyzing two datasets spanning from 2020 to 2024, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights that shed light on the dynamics of the data science industry worldwide.

Materials:
For this project, we utilized two datasets covering different time periods, ranging from 2020 to 2024. These datasets were sourced to provide a comprehensive view of the data science job market over time.

Data Preparation:
Before combining the two datasets, it was crucial to ensure consistency and uniformity in the data format. This involved matching values to a standardized format across both datasets. Using Excel, we formatted the data to ensure consistency and compatibility with Power BI. Additionally, data cleaning procedures were implemented to remove any inconsistencies or errors.

Attributes Present in the Dataset:
The datasets contained a total of 13 columns, each providing valuable insights into various aspects of data science jobs. These attributes included:

Work Year
Job Title
Job Category
Salary Currency
Salary
Salary in USD
Employee Residence
Experience Level
Employment Type
Work Setting
Company Location
Company Size

Enhancements and Modifications:
Several enhancements and modifications were made to the datasets to improve clarity and usability:

#Addition of the "Job Category" column to the 2020-2024 dataset.

#Rearrangement of columns for better clarity and organization.

#Use of ChatGPT and XLOOKUP in Excel to map job titles to their respective job categories.

#Replacement of ISO codes with country names for the "Employee Residence" and "Company Location" columns.

#Conversion of employment types from "FT" to "Full-time".

#Adjustment of work settings from "100, 50, 0" to "Remote, Hybrid, In-person" for clarity and consistency.

#Data Cleaning and Integration:

Following these enhancements and modifications, the datasets underwent thorough cleaning to remove any inconsistencies, errors, or duplicate entries. Once cleaned, the datasets were combined to create a unified dataset ready for analysis.

Conclusion:
The preparation and formatting of the datasets for analysis laid the foundation for the creation of a comprehensive dashboard that provides valuable insights into the global data science job market. With clean and structured data in hand, we are now ready to proceed with the visualization and analysis phase of the project.
